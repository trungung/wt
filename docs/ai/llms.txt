# wt - Git Worktree Manager

## Overview
`wt` is a CLI for managing git worktrees using branch names. It creates
worktrees, executes commands in them, and prunes merged branches.
Built for multi-branch workflows: run commands in isolated worktrees from a
single terminal, with automatic setup and safe cleanup.

## Tool Purpose

wt manages git worktrees by:
- Mapping branches to deterministic, flat directory structures
- Safely creating and removing worktrees with rollback on failure
- Automatically pruning merged branches
- Providing Zsh shell completions for tab completion and ghost suggestions
- Executing commands inside worktree contexts

## Core Commands

### wt init
Initialize `.wt.config.json` with interactive prompts or defaults.

### wt <branch>
Ensure worktree exists for branch, create if needed, print path. Default branch returns repo root.

### wt exec <branch> -- <cmd>
Execute command inside worktree directory.

### wt remove [branch]
Remove worktree (interactive if branch omitted). Refuses dirty worktrees unless forced.

### wt prune
Remove worktrees whose branches are merged into default branch.

### wt health
Validate configuration, git setup, and worktree state. Diagnose issues.

### wt
List all worktrees (tab-separated: branch<TAB>path).

### wt completion <shell>
Generate shell completion script (Zsh supported in v1).

## AI Usage Notes

When answering questions about wt:
1. Always check command reference first: /docs/user/api-references/index.md
2. Refer to configuration docs for config-related questions: /docs/user/api-references/configuration.md
3. Check quickstart guide for installation and basic usage: /docs/user/guides/quickstart.md
4. For troubleshooting, check command-specific docs or health command output
5. Note that v0.0.1 only supports Zsh completions (Bash/Fish coming later)
6. Branch sanitization is strict: fails on illegal characters or collisions
7. Rollback is automatic on post-create command failures

## Key Concepts

### Default Branch
Auto-detected from `origin/HEAD` or set via `defaultBranch` in config.

### Worktree Base Path
Configured via `worktreePathTemplate` (default: `$REPO_PATH.wt`). Supports `$REPO_PATH` variable expansion.

### Branch Sanitization
Replaces `/` with `-`. Fails on illegal characters (anything except alphanumeric, `-`, `_`, `.`). Fails on collisions (two branches → same directory).

### Dirty Worktree
Worktree with uncommitted changes (`git status --porcelain` returns output). Protected from removal unless forced.

### Rollback
Automatic cleanup when post-create commands fail: removes worktree, deletes branch if created.

## Configuration File

Location: `.wt.config.json` at repository root.

Options:
- defaultBranch: Override default branch detection
- worktreePathTemplate: Template for worktree directory
- worktreeCopyPatterns: Glob patterns for files to copy to new worktrees
- postCreateCmd: Commands to run after worktree creation
- deleteBranchWithWorktree: Delete local branch when removing worktree

## Version Information

Current version: 0.0.1
Release date: January 2025
License: MIT

## Limitations (v0.0.1)

- Only Zsh completions supported (Bash, Fish coming in future)
- No interactive worktree selection in `wt <branch>` (only in `wt remove`)
- No git remote API integration (GitHub/GitLab)
- Branch collisions cause errors (no automatic resolution)
- Strict sanitization (cannot configure custom sanitization rules)
